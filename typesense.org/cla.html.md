        <h2>Why is this agreement necessary?</h2>
        <p>We very much appreciate your wanting to contribute to Typesense, but we need to add you to the contributors
            list first.</p>
        <p>Note that the following agreement is not a transfer of copyright ownership, this simply is a license
            agreement for contributions. You also do not change your rights to use your own contributions for any other
            purpose.</p>
        <p>For some background on why contributor license agreements are necessary, you can read FAQs from many other
            open source projects:</p>

                FAQ</a></li>

        </ul>
        <p>This is part of the legal framework of the open-source ecosystem that adds some red tape, but protects both
            the contributor and the company / foundation behind the project. It also gives us the option to relicense
            the code with a more permissive license in the future.</p>

        <h2>Terms of the Agreement</h2>

        <p>This Contributor License Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into between Typesense Inc., a Delaware
            corporation (“Typesense,” “we” or “us” etc.) and you (as defined and further identified below). Accordingly,
            you hereby agree to the following terms for your past, present and future contributions submitted to
            Typesense:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Definitions.
                    "You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner
                    that is making this Agreement with Typesense. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution
                    and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity
                    are considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i)
                    the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by
                    contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares,
                    or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
                    "Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions
                    to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to Typesense for inclusion in, or
                    documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by Typesense (the "Work"). For the purposes
                    of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
                    to Typesense or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic
                    mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on
                    behalf of, Typesense for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding
                    communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a
                    Contribution."</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Grant of Copyright License.
                    Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Typesense and to
                    recipients of software distributed by Typesense a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
                    royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly
                    display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative
                    works.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Grant of Patent License.
                    Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Typesense and to
                    recipients of software distributed by Typesense a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
                    royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use,
                    offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to
                    those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone
                    or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.
                    If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim
                    or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have
                    contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                    granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the
                    date such litigation is filed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above license. If your employer(s) has
                    rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that
                    you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer
                    has waived such rights for your Contributions to Typesense, or that your employer has executed a
                    separate Corporate CLA with Typesense.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see section 7 for
                    submissions on behalf of others). You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete
                    details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related
                    patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of
                    Your Contributions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to
                    provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by
                    applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
                    WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any
                    warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
                    PURPOSE.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to Typesense
                    separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license
                    or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license
                    agreements) of which you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on
                    behalf of a third-party: [named here]".</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You agree to notify Typesense of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make
                    these representations inaccurate in any respect.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
