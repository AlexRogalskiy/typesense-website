            Typesense is an open source, typo tolerant search engine that is
            optimized for <strong>instant sub-50ms searches</strong>, while
            providing an <strong>intuitive developer experience</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are a lean bootstrapped team of engineers passionate about making
            great search technology accessible to everyone. We believe that
            search technology choices widely available to developers today,
            either have a steep learning curve and a heavy operational burden,
            or are proprietary and expensive.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Our goal is to democratize search</strong>. We want to
            reduce the time-to-market for developers to build a blazing fast
            search experience that provides relevant results out-of-the-box, all
            without breaking the bank and without operational overhead.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are a small team trying to do big things and we believe that open
            sourcing our work helps combine forces with our community and
            force-multiply our collective efforts. If our work resonates with
            you, we‚Äôd love to have you
